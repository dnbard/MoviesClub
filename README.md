Movies to-watch application.
Plenty movies to watch and still can't remember any when there is time to watch something? I solved this issue for myself with this simple application. 

Application will parse movie info from various sources and saves it until you will have time to watch your movie. Clean and simple. 

Backend: nodejs, mongodb;
Frontend: knockoutjs, twitter bootstrap.

Application available at: http://moviesclub.herokuapp.com/ (email me if you want to use it as right now registration is closed).
